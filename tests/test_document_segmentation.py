        DOCUMENT 1 - MEETING MINUTES
        Date: January 10, 2025

        This is the content of document 1.
        It has multiple paragraphs with very specific topic about meetings.
        Attendees: John Smith, Mary Johnson, Bob Williams

        This is the second paragraph with content about the project milestones.
        The document continues with details specific to this meeting.
        Action items: Review timeline, prepare budget estimates

        DOCUMENT 2 - CHANGE ORDER
        Project: Construction Project ABC
        Date: February 15, 2025

        This is a completely different document with different content about change orders.
        The writing style and terminology has changed significantly.

        Change order number: CO-12345
        Amount: $25,000.00
        Description: Additional foundation work required due to soil conditions.

        This document discusses changes to the scope of work.
        Approved by: Robert Johnson, Project Manager

        DOCUMENT 3 - DAILY REPORT

        This is yet another document with different subject matter related to daily activities.
        The semantic content of this document differs significantly from the previous ones.

        Work performed:
        - Excavation in section A-3
        - Concrete pouring in section B-2
        - Installation of electrical conduits in section C-1
